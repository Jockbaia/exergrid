## Abstract

Nowadays, rehabilitation procedures for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) are supported by an increasing number of techniques. The aim of this thesis is to empower traditional exercises through recent innovations in mixed reality (combining real and digital elements in the same setting, making the computer-generated items encrusted in the physical setting). This is achieved by developing an interactive environment where rehabilitation tasks are coupled with game-like features with augmentative audio and video cues. The test setting for this thesis focuses on upper limb rehabilitation, with a grid-like structure where the user must place a virtual cube according to a set of rules and constraints requiring the individual capability to control the execution of repetitive actions without violating specific limitations. The effectiveness of this method is initially assessing the performance and experience of users without MS through a series of playtesting sessions as preliminary tests before involving people with MS. The thesis discusses and demonstrates how the engaging features of mixed reality can actively reduce the detrimental effects of repetitive exercises, further improving individual adherence to clinical procedures.
